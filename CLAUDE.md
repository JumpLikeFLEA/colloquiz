# Design fidelity rules

- `/figma-export` is the visual source of truth (Vite + React + Tailwind)
- We are porting it to Next.js, preserving visual output exactly
- Never change, simplify, or substitute Tailwind classes, spacing, colors, or DOM structure
- Only allowed changes: Next.js-specific (`next/link`, `next/image`, app router, `'use client'` directives)
- If a conflict between Figma code and Next.js forces a visual change, stop and ask

## Intentional deviations from /figma-export
- Body font: Geist via next/font (Figma export had no font loaded; 
  this is a deliberate choice, do not remove)
- AuthScreen (app/(auth)/AuthScreen.tsx): stats row ("47 Subjects / 10k+ 
  Learners / 500k+ Quizzes") and the Terms of Service / Privacy Policy 
  line removed at user request (2026-07-06); do not restore
- AuthScreen: "Check your email" confirmation view added (2026-07-08) for 
  the Supabase email-confirmation flow; not in the Figma export (which had 
  no auth logic). Composed entirely from classes already used elsewhere in 
  AuthScreen.tsx; do not remove
- AuthScreen: emerald notice box (2026-07-08) mirroring the error box 
  structure, for "email confirmed, please sign in" after clicking a 
  confirmation link on another device; do not remove
- AuthScreen: left decorative panel width changed (2026-07-08) from the 
  Figma fixed widths (w-[460px] xl:w-[520px]) to w-[40%] so the screen 
  splits roughly 40% panel / 60% form at user request; do not restore the 
  fixed widths
- AuthScreen: `redirectTo` prop added (2026-07-09) for the tutor invite-link 
  flow — after sign-in/sign-up the user lands on the `?next=` destination 
  (validated relative path) instead of always "/". Logic-only, no visual 
  change; do not remove
- SubjectGrid (app/components/SubjectGrid.tsx): full-width "Any difficulty" 
  pill added below the Easy/Medium/Hard row and preselected (2026-07-13), and 
  the "Choose a difficulty above to start" warning removed with it. The warning 
  was an absolutely-positioned popover that covered the pill row it pointed at; 
  a default makes the card startable on render, so the error state cannot occur. 
  Sends difficulty "mixed", same as Random Quiz. Built from classes already used 
  by the sibling pills; do not restore the warning
